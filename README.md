This workshop was organized to raise awareness about developer diversity and inclusion challenges faced by industry today. Our intent was to understand these challenges more clearly, to brainstorm concrete goals to address them, and to gather recommendations and best practices to share with practitioners.  We also aimed to build a community of researchers and practitioners that share a passion to improve software developer diversity and inclusion.  The workshop had a mix of invited keynote presentations and facilitator led discussions.

<img align="left" src="https://blog.fluchtforschung.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Profile-5.jpg" width = 100> **Diversity and Heterogeneity** The looming threat of another Cold War reminds us how easily the world can become divided — again. Differences were never truly eradicated by multiculturalism or globalization, no matter how much it was presumed they would. In this talk I wish to probe two ways of how differences are organised and presented: one is the mode of diversity, the other heterogeneity. 

Diversity means varied styles, while heterogeneity means different natures. Diversity can be found in places like universities, the headquarters of the United Nations, the offices of Google, and international art festivals. In these places, people are visibly different, lead explicitly different lifestyles, and celebrate their differences, even if they may talk, think and act in similar ways. Meanwhile, we encounter heterogeneities in the peripheries of Calcutta, Johannesburg, or São Paulo, and in border towns in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Social activities of different natures entangle with each other: formal, and informal; legal, and illegal; licit, and illicit. 

Diversity and heterogeneity are not mutually exclusive. There are abundant heterogeneities in places of diversity. Hierarchy in status is an important dimension of heterogeneity, for instance the divide between citizens, legal and illegal migrants, as well as between permanent staff, temporary workers and interns. Heterogeneities are the basis of how profits are made, and power sustained. But heterogeneities are not always critically scrutinized, and are sometimes masked as concerns about diversity. The growing app-based platform economy has multiplied heterogeneities—in labour relations, social status, and ideological positions.

Xiang is the winner of the 2008 Anthony Leeds Prize for his book Global Bodyshopping and the 2012 William L. Holland Prize for his article ‘Predatory Princes’. His 2000 Chinese book 跨越边界的社区 (published in English as Transcending Boundaries, 2005) was reprinted in 2018 as a contemporary classic.
